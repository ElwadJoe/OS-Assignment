pause and resume I'm pretty sure this doesn't need explanation :)

in the linker question i modified the name of the function in the first file so i got an error when i tried to compile both files , the role of the linker is to connect the .c files as a single program and the error happened because file 2 couldn't find the name of the function it had in file 1

role of the loader is to load the executable file into the memory so the CPU can execute it
3 shared libraries are used in the program
linux-vdso.so.1

/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
